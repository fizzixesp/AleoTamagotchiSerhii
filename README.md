## 🐶 Project Overview

In this virtual pet world, you're tasked with caring for your pet's well-being by managing its:

- Saturation
- Health
- Happiness
- Block heights for creation, updating, feeding, and playing.

Pets start with a saturation, health, and happiness value of `8640`, ensuring 12 hours of carefree life considering an average block time of 5 seconds. Keep your pet satiated to maintain its health and happiness, or face the consequences of neglect.

### 🍽️ Feeding Your Pet

Feed your pet with a variety of dishes to maintain its saturation, and indirectly, its health and happiness. Below is the menu of available dishes:

| Dish ID | Dish Type            | Cost ($ALEO) | Saturation Increase | Happiness Increase | Health Increase | Health Decrease |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 0       | Basic Food           | 2            | 2000                | -                  | -               | -               |

## 📝 Essential Transitions

Your pet's life cycle is managed through a series of smart contract functions:

- `top_up_balance`: Ensure your pet's account has enough $ALEO tokens for their needs.
- `create`: Begin your journey by creating a new pet with a secret key and the current block height.
- `update`: Regularly update your pet's status to keep track of their well-being.
- `feed`: Choose from a diverse menu to nourish your pet.
- `play`: Engage in playful activities to boost happiness.
- `heal`: When health runs low, provide your pet with the necessary medical attention.

Remember, all pets live on the blockchain, providing a secure and permanent home for your digital companion.
